##Description
This project will create a clone of IMDB allowing for movie reviews.

##How to install
(TBD)

##How to use
(TBD)



##Questions for client

- Should we be live-querying a movie site like IMDB, seeding from an existing database, or populating fictional movies/reviews, etc.?
- What is the expectation for user interface? Is there a specific design we're aiming for?
- Movies and TV and showtimes? Just movies? What's the basic scope?
- How much metadata do we need on each movie?
- What kinds of restrictions and kinds of reviews can users leave?
- What other functionality should be available to the user? (e.g. polls, favorites, subscribing to other users' lists)
- What kind of authorization do we need/what kind of user system?
- Are there other explicit features we want to define (e.g. top 250 lists)? Polls?
- Are there services from other websites you want us to use?
- Are there email communications we should send to the user?
- Of the above, what are the most important features that must be in the MVP?
- Checking in with client
-- How do you want to see progress?
-- How frequently would you like to check in? Under what circumstances?
-- What do you expect to see on Trello?
- Demo
-- What would you like to see us demo in particular?
-- What would you like to see as pie-in-the-sky features that we can't promise but will try to get to?

##Questions for team lead
 - Say more about this "fork" git workflow


##Team norms

- Check-ins frequently: morning, after lunch, before departure
- Communicating about pushing code/adhering to git flow
- particularly, peer-reviewed merging of pull requests
- merges happen with whole team
- tests: at the beginning is ideal; definitely by the end (models + features)
- getting stuck: solicit team members or instructor help after 20-30 minutes
- know what we're working on (use Trello) with constant communication
- unofficial check-ins anytime for any reason (kaizen rope pull)
- aspire to spend some time at EOD refactoring existing code
- continuous, direct, recent feedback
- work-life balance: lunches are free, no expectations outside core hours
- no swears in pull requests
